    "## Analyzing Weather Sentiments in Tweets\n",
    "\n",
    "In this exercise, we consider the [Weather sentiment](https://data.world/crowdflower/weather-sentiment) dataset from [Crowdflower](https://www.crowdflower.com/).\n",
    "\n",
    "To create this dataset, contributors were asked to grade the sentiment of a particular tweet relating to the weather. Contributors could choose among the following categories:\n",
    "1. Positive\n",
    "2. Negative\n",
    "3. I can't tell\n",
    "4. Neutral / author is just sharing information\n",
    "5. Tweet not related to weather condition\n",
    "\n",
    "The catch is that 20 contributors graded each tweet. Thus, in many cases contributors assigned conflicting sentiment labels to the same tweet. \n",
    "\n",
    "In the `data` directory, you will find the file [weather-non-agg-DFE.csv](data/weather-non-agg-DFE.csv) containing the raw contributor answers for each of the 1,000 tweets.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "The fields of the csv file are as follows:\n",
    "1. **_unit\\_id_**: CrowdFlower’s numeric ID for the unit,\n",
    "2. **channel**: channel via which the contributor entered the job,\n",
    "3. **trust**: the contributor's accuracy level in the current job, determined by their accuracy on the Test Questions they’ve seen in the job,\n",
    "4. **worker_id**: CrowdFlower Contributor ID,\n",
    "5. **country**: worker's country code\n",
    "6. **region**: worker's region\n",
    "7. **city**: worker's city\n",
    "8. **emotion**: worker's assigned emotion to the tweet\n",
    "9. **tweet_id**: id of the tweet\n",
    "10. **tweet_body**: body text of the tweet\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Our goal in this exercise is to build a classifier that predicts the tweet's emotion according to the aforementioned categories. Towards that, we will be first aggregating the results of the crowdflower task in order to get a clean dataset. Then we will be preparing the data features by tokenizing the text. Finally, we will be inputting these features into a text classifier. \n"
